An Irish language file for [FuzzyClock][fc] (OS X).

For best results, use a Gaelic typeface such as [Glanchló][gc].

Installation
------------

1. Look for FuzzyClock in Finder (most likely located in the `/Applications`
folder). Right-click it and select 'Show Package Contents'.

2. From this new window, open `Contents`, then `Resources`.

3. Copy the `Gaeilge.lproj` folder to this `Resources` folder.

4. Restart FuzzyClock, and a new 'Gaeilge' option should be available in the
languages list.


Uninstallation
--------------

Retrace steps 1 and 2 above to find the `Resources` folder.
Trash `Gaeilge.lproj`.

I'm still recovering from the dark days of the Leaving Cert. If you've spotted
any grammatical errors, please let me know. You can fork this project, or
